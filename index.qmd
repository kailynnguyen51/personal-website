### Bio

I am currently a 4th year Statistics and Data Science Major at University of California, Los Angeles. I was first introduced to computer science and engineering through Girl Code @Stanford, a student program that aims to teach young high school girls the coding basics. After graduation, I hope to use my developed skills to enter the tech industry.

Attached is my current [CV](CV.pdf "CV").
